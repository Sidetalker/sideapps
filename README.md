## See It In Action

The site is live at [sideapps.com](https://sideapps.com)

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy

The project is configured for static deployment so there are no prerequisites to host on your site. Simply run

```bash
npm run build
```

and copy the contents of the `out` folder to the root of your site.

## Personal Use

If you want to use this as a template for your own site, feel free. I'd appreciate a GitHub star and a link to my site, but nothing is required.
