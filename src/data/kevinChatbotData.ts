  career: [
    "I've been building iOS apps for over a decade now. Started my career doing everything from laundry logistics to fintech to telehealth. Each gig taught me something wildly different about what users actually need vs what stakeholders think they need 😅",
    "Career-wise, I've worn a lot of hats — solo dev, tech lead, engineering manager. My sweet spot is probably that lead engineer role where I'm still writing code daily but also shaping the architecture and mentoring the team.",
    "I've had the privilege of working at places like Capital One, Chewy, and Amwell. Also did a stint with the Alliance of American Football which was genuinely one of the most intense and fun projects I've ever touched. Real-time 3D graphics during live games? Wild.",
    "The through-line in my career has been this: take something complex and make it feel effortless for the user. Whether it's scheduling laundry pickup or managing a veterinary practice, the best apps just get out of the way."
  ],
  washloft: [
    "WashLoft is basically Uber for laundry — on demand pickup and delivery of clean, folded clothes. I was the solo iOS dev on it. Built the whole thing with Swift, Firebase, and Stripe. Even made companion apps for the drivers and washers. It serves hundreds of orders a month in the Boston area. I'm pretty proud of that one 💪",
    "WashLoft was a great learning experience as a solo developer. Building three interconnected apps (customer, driver, washer) taught me a ton about shared codebases — I ended up designing a shared SPM package to keep things DRY across all three."
  ],
  capitalOne: [
    "At Capital One I was the technical lead for the Small Business Banking iOS team. We increased parity with the web and consumer apps by over 70% in the first year, which was a massive push. Our features served over 10k unique users daily and we maintained 90%+ code coverage on everything we shipped.",
    "Capital One was where I really leveled up as a tech lead. Working across multiple cross-functional teams, driving the mobile strategy... it was a masterclass in balancing technical excellence with business priorities."
  ],
  chewy: [
    "Chewy was incredible. I was the Lead Mobile Engineer on the PracticeHub team — it's a platform for veterinarians to manage their practice and approve prescription requests. I built the team from scratch, designed the core architecture, and we delivered the full app in 10 months. The best part? We reduced customer service workload by 99% with the self-service portal 🎉",
    "At Chewy I got to build a mobile engineering team and ship a product that 1000s of veterinarians use daily. PracticeHub was one of those projects where everything just clicked — great team, clear vision, and real impact on real people."
  ],
  aaf: [
    "The Alliance of American Football was a ride. I was a mobile engineer on their flagship app, handling live game streaming for 10k+ concurrent users. We built real-time custom 3D graphics of the playing field, a completely custom animated scoreboard, and play-by-play betting odds using advanced sports analytics. Then the league folded after one season 💀 But what a season.",
    "AAF was probably the most technically challenging and fun project I've worked on. Real-time 3D rendering, live streaming, sports betting algorithms... all on mobile. We iterated incredibly fast to support the league's launch. It was chaos in the best way."
  ],
  amwell: [
    "At Amwell (American Well) I was the Lead iOS Engineer and Manager for the clinician-facing app. Served thousands of clinicians nationwide. I proposed and led the Swift migration to modernize the codebase, built live video conferencing features, custom scheduling, and even hopped into the backend API when needed. Telehealth before telehealth was cool 😎",
  ],
  apps: [
    "Where to start? Professionally — WashLoft (Uber for laundry), Capital One's small business banking app, Chewy's PracticeHub for vets, the AAF football app with live 3D graphics, and Amwell's clinician telehealth app. On the personal side, my first featured App Store app was SplatPal, a companion for Splatoon. Also built TapMonkeys, MyNoise (a colored noise generator), MapPlant for route visualization, and more recently some tools for a Colorado real estate team.",
    "I've got 123 repos on GitHub if you want to browse the personal stuff 😅 Some highlights: SplatPal was my first App Store feature — a Splatoon companion app with a watchOS component. MyNoise is a colored noise generator using AudioToolbox. MapPlant does elegant route visualization on iOS and Apple Watch. I'm always tinkering with something."
  ],
  splatpal: [
    "SplatPal! That was my baby — my first app featured on the App Store, about 10 years ago now. It was a companion app for Splatoon on Wii U. Custom UI matching the game's ink-splatter aesthetic, a full database of weapons and gear, a watchOS app for the original Apple Watch, real-time map rotation data from Nintendo's SplatNet API, and a custom sharing feature over SMS. I put so much love into that thing ❤️",
  ],
  techStack: [
    "My bread and butter is Swift — I've been writing it since the early days. UIKit is where I'm most battle-tested, but I'm digging SwiftUI more and more for new projects. Beyond that: Firebase, Stripe for payments, SPM for package management, XCTest for coverage. On the tooling side — Xcode obviously, Fastlane for CI/CD, and I'm always experimenting with new stuff.",
    "Swift and UIKit are my home turf, been working with them for over a decade. I also do SwiftUI, Core Data, Combine, and I've dabbled in backend work when needed. I'm a big believer in clean architecture, high test coverage, and shared packages to keep multi-app codebases sane."
  ],
  swift: [
    "Swift is one of those languages that just keeps getting better. I've been writing it since the 1.0 days — through all the breaking syntax changes, the ABI stability journey, all of it. It's matured into something really elegant. Concurrency with async/await was a game changer.",
    "I love Swift. I've written it professionally for 10+ years. The type system, protocol-oriented programming, value types... it encourages you to write correct code. And it's fast. The developer experience compared to Objective-C (which I also wrote plenty of) is night and day."
  ],
  swiftui: [
    "SwiftUI is getting there. It's not 100% ready to replace UIKit for every use case, but for new views and screens it's fantastic. The declarative syntax, live previews, and how well it plays with Combine... I'm increasingly reaching for it first. But UIKit knowledge is still essential — you'll need it for the edge cases SwiftUI doesn't handle yet.",
  ],
  crypto: [
    "I'm what you'd call a cautious crypto enthusiast. I've been active on the DeSo blockchain — posted on Diamond, BitClout, minted some NFTs. I love the idea of decentralized social media where creators actually own their content. That said, I've seen plenty of rug pulls and scams firsthand. I've called people out publicly when they've burned investors. The space needs more accountability 💎",
    "Crypto is fascinating tech with a real trust problem. I've been deep in the DeSo ecosystem — creator coins, NFTs, generative art collections. But I've also seen people buy my creator coin just to dump it for profit a week later. The community aspect is genuine, the speculation... less so.",
    "I'm into crypto from a tech and community perspective — decentralized social networks, NFTs as a creative medium, that kind of thing. I've made generative art collections and participated in the DeSo community. But I'm also the guy calling out scammers in the replies. Transparency matters 🫣"
  ],
  nft: [
    "I've minted a few NFT collections on DeSo — generative art pieces like my Slopes collection, Water & Fire, Rainbow Burst. I see NFTs as a creative canvas more than an investment vehicle. The art is the point. When people treat it purely as speculation, that's when it goes sideways.",
    "My NFT stuff is all generative art. I love the intersection of code and visual art — writing algorithms that produce beautiful, unique pieces. It's very different from building apps but uses the same creative muscle in a weird way."
  ],
  deso: [
    "DeSo (Decentralized Social) is interesting — a blockchain built specifically for social media. I've been active on Diamond and BitClout. I like the concept of creator coins and that creators can actually monetize their presence natively. The community is small but passionate. I've done diamond showers, participated in quizzes, called out scammers... the whole experience 😅",
  ],
  ai: [
    "AI is... a lot right now 🫣 My GitHub bio says \"Did AI turn off the lights yet?\" and I half mean it. I'm genuinely excited about the creative possibilities — I've been playing with text-to-video models and the results are wild. But the pace of change is borderline unsettling. As a developer, I'm simultaneously thrilled and existentially nervous.",
    "I'm an AI enthusiast with a healthy dose of skepticism. The generative stuff is incredible — text-to-video, image generation, LLMs. I've been experimenting with it for creative projects. But I think we need to be thoughtful about where this all goes. The \"move fast and break things\" approach to AI feels different when the thing you might break is... everything? 💀",
    "Been experimenting with text-to-video AI models recently and the quality is getting scary good. As a developer, AI tools are genuinely making me more productive. As a human... \"Did AI turn off the lights yet?\" 🫣"
  ],
  dog: [
    "Java! She's my best girl 🐕 Named her after the programming language, obviously. She loves runs in the park, hanging out with her buddy Charlie, and one time she had the most confused standoff with a chipmunk that's still one of my favorite photos ever. She's been to Arches National Park, Colorado sunsets... she's living her best life.",
    "My dog Java is the real star of my social media. She's a sweetheart — I post photos of her constantly. Her and her friend Charlie are inseparable. She once met a very confused chipmunk in the park and the photo is pure gold 💕",
    "Java the dog > Java the language. There, I said it. She's my adventure buddy — we've done Colorado, national parks, tons of park runs. She's the most photogenic creature I know."
  ],
  gaming: [
    "I'm definitely a gamer. Splatoon was such a big deal for me that I built a whole companion app (SplatPal) for it. More recently I've been playing Oddsparks — I actually built automation systems in it, because of course I did. When you're a developer, every game becomes an optimization puzzle 😅",
    "Gaming is a big part of my life. My first featured App Store app was literally a Splatoon companion app. I tend to gravitate toward games where I can build and optimize things. Oddsparks has been my recent obsession — I built a full vial production and automation system in it. Can't turn off the engineer brain."
  ],
  art: [
    "I love generative art — writing code that produces visual pieces. There's something magical about defining rules and constraints and then watching beautiful, unexpected patterns emerge. My Slopes collection, Water & Fire, Rainbow Burst... they're all algorithmic but feel organic. It's my favorite intersection of engineering and creativity.",
    "Generative art is where my developer brain and creative side collide. I've published several collections — abstract pieces generated by algorithms I've written. Each piece is unique because of controlled randomness. It's coding as art and I'm fully addicted."
  ],
  opensource: [
    "I've contributed to a handful of open source projects. I forked the 1Password app extension to add some features, contributed SPM support to PMAlertController, built piknik-ios as an iOS client for the piknik clipboard tool... I also help out on StackOverflow with iOS and Swift questions. I believe in giving back to the community that taught me.",
  ],
  github: [
    "I've got 123 repos on GitHub, 1,524 contributions in the last year, and I'm an Arctic Code Vault Contributor which sounds way cooler than it probably is 😅 My contribution graph is about 81% commits, 12% PRs, 5% code review, and 2% issues. I'm always building something.",
    "GitHub.com/Sidetalker — 123 repos and counting. My popular ones are TapMonkeys (TypeMonkeys for iOS), MyNoise (colored noise generator), SplatPal, MapPlant, and SeaFoam. I've been on there since 2012 and the contribution graph tells the story of a dev who can't stop shipping."
  ],
  location: [
    "I'm based in Wilmington, DE right now. I've also spent time in the Boston area (WashLoft was a Boston thing) and Colorado — beautiful sunsets out there, great for hiking with Java. Wilmington is home base though, close enough to Philly and NYC but with that Delaware no-sales-tax life 😎",
  ],
  education: [
    "I've got a BS in Computer Science, which gave me a solid foundation. But honestly, most of what I know came from building things. There's no substitute for shipping real products to real users. The CS degree taught me how to think about problems; the decade of iOS development taught me how to solve them.",
  ],
  leadership: [
    "I've evolved from solo dev to tech lead to engineering manager over my career. At Capital One I led the Small Business Banking iOS team across cross-functional squads. At Chewy I literally built a mobile engineering team from scratch. At Amwell I was both lead engineer and manager. My leadership style is hands-on — I'm never too senior to write code, review PRs, or debug a gnarly production issue alongside the team.",
    "The best engineering leaders I've seen (and what I try to be) are the ones who can zoom out to architecture and strategy, then zoom back in to help debug a specific crash. I lead by doing, not just directing."
  ],
  journeyWest: [
    "Journey West is a recent project — I built a toolkit for a Colorado real estate team. It includes an email signature studio with live previews and brand templates, and an enhanced ArcGIS-based property viewer for Summit County parcels and zoning data. It's a totally different domain from my usual iOS work but the problem-solving is the same: understand the user, make it simple.",
  ],
  advice: [
    "Honestly? Ship things. The gap between a junior and senior dev isn't years of experience, it's number of real products shipped to real users. Every app you put in the App Store teaches you something a tutorial never will. Also: test your code. 90%+ coverage isn't overkill, it's insurance.",
    "My advice for iOS devs: learn UIKit deeply even if SwiftUI is the future. Understand the fundamentals — memory management, the responder chain, Auto Layout. Then layer SwiftUI on top. And contribute to open source. You'll learn so much from reading other people's code.",
    "Build something you actually want to use. My best projects started because I was scratching my own itch — SplatPal because I played Splatoon, MyNoise because I needed ambient sound. Passion projects teach you more than any course."
  ],
  hello: [
    "Hey! What's up? I'm Kevin — iOS developer, AI tinkerer, crypto experimenter, and full-time dog dad to Java. What can I chat about? 👋",
    "Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Ask me about apps, Swift, crypto, my dog... whatever's on your mind 🤙",
    "What's good! I'm Kevin. If you've got questions about iOS development, my projects, crypto takes, or just want to see why my dog is the best dog ever, fire away."
  ],
  thanks: [
    "No problem at all! Happy to chat 🤙",
    "Anytime! That's what I'm here for.",
    "You got it ✌️ Anything else on your mind?"
  ],
  hobbies: [
    "When I'm not coding: gaming (Splatoon, Oddsparks), making generative art, hiking with Java, exploring crypto communities, and honestly... still coding but on fun personal projects instead 😅 I also enjoy photography — mostly of Colorado sunsets and my dog.",
    "My hobbies are basically my work but without deadlines. Personal coding projects, generative art, gaming, crypto community stuff, outdoor adventures with Java. I'm also a low-key comedy nerd — George Carlin is a hero."
  ],
  funny: [
    "Did AI turn off the lights yet? 🫣 ...asking for a friend who may or may not be an LLM.",
    "My dog is named Java and she's never thrown a NullPointerException, so she's already better than the language 💀",
    "I once built a laundry app and my own laundry still piled up. The cobbler's children have no shoes, but worse.",
    "123 GitHub repos and I still google how to center a div. We're all frauds, just at different scales."
  ],
  motivation: [
    "What makes me tick? Solving problems that matter to real people. Whether it's helping vets manage prescriptions or letting someone schedule laundry pickup from their couch... technology should remove friction from life, not add it.",
    "I'm driven by that feeling when you ship something and someone says \"this just works.\" That's the goal. Not flashy, not clever — just seamless. Everything else is noise."
  ],
  freelance: [
    "I run SideApps as my own shop. I've done a mix of full-time roles and contract/freelance work over the years. Right now I'm building tools, personal projects, and staying open to interesting opportunities. If you've got an iOS project that needs a senior dev who's shipped at scale, let's talk — hit me up through sideapps.com 🤙",
  ],
  colorado: [
    "Colorado is gorgeous. I spent time there and fell in love with the sunsets — seriously, they hit different at altitude. Java and I explored Arches National Park, did some Summit County adventures... I even built tools for a real estate team out there (Journey West). The tech scene is growing too.",
  ],
  philosophy: [
    "What makes you tick? Seriously, I love asking people that. For me it's the craft of building things — the satisfaction of turning an abstract idea into something someone can hold in their hand and use. There's a meditative quality to coding when you're in flow. It's the closest thing to magic I've found.",
    "I think about legacy a lot. Not in a dramatic way, but... the apps I build touch real people's lives. A vet who can approve prescriptions faster, a person who gets clean laundry delivered, a gamer who can track their loadout... small things that add up. That matters to me."
  ],
  testing: [
    "Testing is non-negotiable. At Capital One we maintained 90%+ code coverage and it saved us countless times. I use XCTest primarily, and I'm a big fan of writing tests that actually test behavior, not implementation details. Snapshot testing for UI is great too. If your code isn't tested, it's a liability.",
  ],
  architecture: [
    "I'm big on clean, scalable architecture. MVVM is my default but I'm not dogmatic — use what fits the problem. At Chewy I designed the core architecture for PracticeHub from scratch. At Capital One it was more about evolving existing patterns. The key is consistency: a new developer should be able to open any file and immediately understand where they are and how things work.",
  ]
};

export const fallbacks = [
  "That's a great question. I'd have to think more on that one — but if it's iOS, crypto, or dog-related, I probably have a strong opinion 😅",
  "Hmm, not sure I have a canned answer for that one. Try asking me about my apps, career, tech stack, or my dog Java and I'll be way more eloquent 🐕",
  "You've stumped the chatbot version of me! The real Kevin would probably have a better answer. Try asking about iOS development, crypto, or my projects?",
  "Interesting... I'll have to marinate on that one. In the meantime, did I mention I have 123 GitHub repos? Ask me about those 😅",
  "I'm better at talking about Swift than I am at small talk. Hit me with a tech question or ask about my dog — those are my two speeds.",
  "That's outside my pre-loaded conversational range 💀 Ask me about my career, what I've built, my crypto takes, or Java (the dog, not the language).",
  "Not gonna pretend I have a smart response for that one. But ask me about building apps at Capital One, Chewy, or for a football league and I'll talk your ear off."
